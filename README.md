# Central README Repository for Logos Projects
**This repository contains `THE README` for the Logos projects, including concepts, research, RFCs and specifications related to the project.**

**The Logos project has the mission to provide the Web3 with an autonomous, community provided, blockchain secured and enterprise grade computational layer, named sub0layer.**

## Project structure
> [!NOTE]  
> Since the project is in the early stages, the structure of the project may change or may be extended.

- **Original concept paper** (logos-network-concept-paper): The concept remains fundamentally the same, but some technical approaches will be executed differently than described in the original paper.

- **Future Comprehensive Network Specifications Paper** (logos-network-technical-specification-paper):    
    This document will serve as the Future Comprehensive Network Specifications Paper. It aims to consolidate all the research and testing conducted on various topics related to the network. Once finalized, this paper will provide a detailed overview of the network specifications, serving as the foundational document for the network's design and implementation.
    
    *Purpose and Process:*  
    The goal of this paper is to capture all the findings, methodologies, and conclusions drawn from our extensive research and testing phases. It will cover various aspects such as architecture, security protocols, transaction handling, key management, and more.

    Once the paper is completed, it will be used to initiate a Request for Comments (RFC). This RFC process is crucial as it invites feedback, suggestions, and additional insights from the broader community, ensuring that the final specifications are robust, well-rounded, and have considered diverse perspectives.

    *Expected Outcomes:*   
    A comprehensive and detailed documentation of the network specifications.
    Constructive feedback and engagement from the community through the RFC process.
    Finalized specifications that are ready for implementation, benefiting from collective insights and peer review.

- **Research** (/research):  
In this section, you will find individual research papers developed by LogosLabs or through collaborations with other entities. 
These papers cover topics that contribute to the provision of the Logos Network. 
All research can also be reviewed in the Logos documentation in [wiki](https://docs.logoslabs.io/research/research-overview) format.

- **General** (.gitignore, ...):   
For a clean code and project some general configurations are necessary.
